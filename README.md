## 🚀 About Me

I’m a results-driven Martech and Data Governance Specialist with deep experience in designing and implementing enterprise-scale data collection strategies across web and mobile. I specialize in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), Tealium iQ, Google Tag Manager, and Customer Journey Analytics, with a focus on scalable tagging frameworks, identity stitching, and real-time personalization.

Whether migrating legacy implementations or enabling new CDP use cases, I thrive at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and architecture — turning complex customer data flows into actionable, compliant outcomes.
