## 🚀 About Me

I'm a results-driven Martech and Data Governance Specialist with deep experience designing and implementing enterprise-scale data collection strategies across web and mobile ecosystems. 

I specialize in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), Tealium iQ, Google Tag Manager (GTM), and Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), with expertise in scalable tagging frameworks, identity resolution, and real-time personalization.

I thrive at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and architecture — turning complex customer data flows into actionable, compliant, and revenue-driving outcomes.
