    url: https://scott-gresack.github.io/portfolio/tool2.html
    description: >
      A Vue.js-based interactive tool for building and validating web analytics tag specifications.
      Tailored for platforms like Adobe Experience Platform, GA4, and Microsoft Clarity,
      it allows real-time payload generation, context-to-XDM mapping, and event visualization.
      Designed to mirror enterprise-level implementation needs.
    features:
      - TailwindCSS UI
      - Context data-to-XDM mapping
      - Supports Adobe Alloy, GA4, Clarity
      - Live payload preview
    purpose: >
      Enables marketers and engineers to generate structured, platform-aligned tag specs quickly and accurately.
    example_usage: |
      # Sample Payload
      {
        "eventType": "pageView",
        "web": {
          "webPageDetails": {
            "name": "homepage"
          }
